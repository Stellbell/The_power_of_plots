# The_power_of_plots
Matplotlib homework
I am submitting my "skeleton" of this assignment as I have struggled in my ability to understand the code for plotting graphs. 
From my "commits"and "data", it is observable, I have tried but am lacking in fundamental understanding which I am very keen to work on and resolve as soon as it is possible.
Once again I am fully aware my knowledge needs to grow and this assignment must be submitted again to be up to standard.
This I am happy to do with the hope that I can overcome the difficulties i have faced.
